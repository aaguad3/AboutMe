Hi there! I'm Adrian. :wave:

I'm a Computer Science student attending the University of Illinois at Chicago. I'm in my final year and currently open to work in Software.

I'm a C++, Java, and Python developer. I'm currently broadening my skillset by learning frontend development to get a more holistic view of the development life cycle.
I have scripting experience with Python and relational database knowledge with SQL. 

I'm comfortable working in teams and I believe sharing knowledge is the best way to build functional software.

Outside of programming, I love to connect with other people and share my interests in music, sports, and the outdoors.

Thanks for visiting, please reach out to my listed contact information.
