Hi there! I'm Adrian. :wave:

I'm a Computer Science student attending the University of Illinois at Chicago. I'm in my final year and currently open to work in any fields of tech.

I'm adept with languages such as C++, Java, and Python primarily with backend implementation. Currently I'm broadening my skillset by learning frontend development to get a more holistic view of the software development life cycle.

I'm comfortable working in teams and I believe sharing knowledge is the best way to build functional software.

Outside of programming, I love to connect with other people and share my interests in music, sports, and the outdoors.

Thanks for visiting, please reach out to my listed contact information.
